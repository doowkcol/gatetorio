[STARTUP] Reading limit switch states:
  M1: open=False, close=False

[STARTUP] Position UNKNOWN - motors between limits
  M1: open=False, close=False → NEEDS SYNC
  M2: open=False, close=False → NEEDS SYNC
  Commands will operate at 30% speed until both motors synced to limits
  Normal operation: OPEN/CLOSE work normally, just slower for safety
